# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  With Video Cloud you can deliver fast, innovative, TV-like experiences out-of-the-box, dynamically insert server-side ads to maximize revenue, and reach your audiences wherever they are.

  <p>
    The platform APIs are RESTful APIs that allow you access almost every aspect of the Video Cloud platform programmatically. Typically the APIs are used to create integration between your CMS or other system, or to build custom apps to serve the specific needs of your users.
