<h1>Client app registration API</h1>

<p>Audience: Callers of Brightcove APIs (OAuth2 client users)</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>To request OAuth access tokens in OAuth flows other than the client
credentials flow, the request must be made against a registered
<em>client app</em>.  This is a record describing the application that will
request tokens and use them to access resources on the user&#39;s behalf,
and there is an API in OAuth to create and manipulate these client app
registrations.</p>

<p>(Technically, token requests in the client credentials flow are made
against a registered client app also, namely the client whose
credentials are being presented; but the authentication flow and
criteria are so different that we treat them separately.  Internally,
client credentials are almost but not entirely the same thing as
client app registrations.)</p>

<h2>Client app registration data</h2>

<p>Client app registrations have the following fields.  All of them
except <code>redirect_url</code> and <code>trusted</code> also appear on client credentials.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>client_id</strong> (UUID, issued at creation time): Identifies the client
app registration.</li>
<li><strong>client_secret</strong> (base64-encoded bit string, issued at creation
time and never disclosed thereafter): For <code>untrusted</code> app
registrations (see below for definitions), this secret is used to
make changes to the app registration.  For <code>trusted</code> registrations,
the secret is irrelevant.  (For client credentials, this is used
to authenticate token requests against the client.)</li>
<li><strong>type</strong> (string, constant, issued at creation time): Equal to
&quot;app_registration&quot; for client app registrations.</li>
<li><strong>name</strong> (string, <code>required</code> at creation time): A short name used to
identify this client app to users.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong> (string, <code>required</code> at creation time): A longer text
used to identify and describe this client app to users.</li>
<li><strong>privilege_level</strong> (integer, issued at creation or update time): An
internal number describing how &quot;sensitive&quot; this registration is
and thus what API endpoints may be used to manipulate it.</li>
<li><strong>issued_to</strong> (string, issued at creation time): A string
designating the entity to whom this client app registration was
issued; if it was issued based on a BC<em>TOKEN authentication, the
value is the MaitreD email address of the BC</em>TOKEN&#39;s user.</li>
<li><strong>issued_user</strong> (integer, issued at creation time): An integer
designating the entity to whom this client app registration was
issued; if it was issued based on a BC<em>TOKEN authentication, the
value is the MaitreD user ID of the BC</em>TOKEN&#39;s user.</li>
<li><strong>issued_at</strong> (timestamp, issued at creation time): Time of issuance
of the client registration.</li>
<li><strong>expires_at</strong> (timestamp, <code>optional argument</code> at creation or update
time, defaults to nil): Time after which the client registration
will no longer be considered valid.</li>
<li><strong>maximum_scope</strong> (scope, <code>required</code> at creation time): Maximum
scope of an access token issued against this client registration.
See &quot;Registration authorization&quot; below for how this scope
parameter is interpreted and what authentication credentials must
be presented to justify the maximum scope.</li>
<li><strong>revoked</strong> (boolean, set only by DELETE requests, cannot be unset):
True if this client registration has been revoked (is no longer
valid).</li>
<li><strong>redirect_url</strong> (string, <code>required</code> at creation time): The OAuth
redirect URL where access tokens will be sent; see the OAuth2
standard for the intended semantics. Must use https protocol.</li>
<li><strong>trusted</strong> (boolean, <code>required</code> at creation time): See &quot;Trusted and
untrusted registrations&quot; below for interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the required arguments for a client app registration create
operation are <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>maximum_scope</code>, <code>redirect_url</code>,
and <code>trusted</code>, and in addition <code>expires_at</code> may be specified.  All
these fields except for <code>trusted</code> may be updated by a PUT request.</p>

<h2>Trusted and untrusted registrations</h2>

<p>A client app registration is either <code>trusted</code> or <code>untrusted</code>.  The
difference, from the user&#39;s point of view, is that before we are
willing to issue an access token for consumption by an untrusted app,
we must have a record that the user has explicitly chosen to trust the
app – we present a page something like the Facebook &quot;Allow this app
access to your account?  It wants blah-de-blah&quot; page, and record the
user&#39;s assent.  For trusted app registrations we do not require this
additional step.  Trusted app registrations are for use by
Brightcove&#39;s own apps; untrusted registrations are for third-party
apps.</p>

<p>Please note that untrusted apps are <strong>not currently supported</strong>. They
can be registered, but cannot acquire tokens. (There is not yet
infrastructure for displaying the trust challenge to the user.)</p>

<h2>Registration authorization</h2>

<p>The mechanics of authorization for client app registration requests
differ between trusted and untrusted registrations, because trusted
registrations confer the right to interpret user authentication
credentials into tokens with real force, and untrusted registrations
do not, at least not without explicit assent by the user.  Thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>To create, view, update, or revoke a <code>trusted</code> client app
registration, you must present authorization credentials sufficient
to authorize the maximum scope (see [Scope authorization][TODO]),
exactly as if you were creating a client credential; and the
restriction of API endpoint based on privilege level is enforced.</li>
<li>To create an <code>untrusted</code> client app registration, no credentials
whatsoever are required.  To view, update, or revoke an untrusted
client app registration, you must present its client ID and secret
as HTTP Basic authentication parameters, exactly as if you were
requesting an access token against a client credential.  For
untrusted app registrations, the restriction of API endpoint based
on privilege level is not enforced.  (Rationale: We want it to be
possible for third parties to request client app registrations with
maximum scopes covering all accounts, which each user will interpret
into their own account by making a trust assertion.  Normally the
privilege level restriction would prohibit registering such a strong
scope except through the private API.)</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, a useful client app registration has maximum scope with a
blanket identity such as &quot;all video cloud accounts&quot; on it.  Scopes of
this sort are subject to two restrictions: they must be accessed
through the private API endpoint, and you must authenticate with your
<strong>devops LDAP (login.arc)</strong> username and password, since no BC_TOKEN
authentication will authorize all Video Cloud accounts at once.
(OAuth doesn&#39;t know what to do with wacky tokens yet.)  <em>If you do not
have a devops account, you cannot use this API.</em></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Suppose you want to register a client app that will ask for tokens
with the operation tag &quot;video-cloud/player/read&quot; on any Video Cloud
account.  To register the client, do something like the following
(where whitespace and comments should be ignored):</p>

<p><strong>XXX In QA environments the &quot;cacert.pem&quot; below is not actually the QA
root cert right now – it is a OAuth self-signed cert.  For the
moment use -k or --insecure to disable CA cert verification in QA.
We will update this document when this is fixed – as a general rule
we do not want to encourage you to use -k. XXX</strong></p>

<pre><code class="sh">curl -i # verbose response
     --cacert cacert.pem # tell curl to trust the QA or Infrastructure Root CA Certificate
     --cert client.crt --key client.key # You need a client certificate to talk to the private endpoint; it&#39;s in //configs/*/*/OAuth/client-cert
     -d # POST body
        &#39;name=my_client # Name of your client app registration
        &amp;description=My%20client%20application # Human readable name of your app registration
        &amp;redirect_url=https://myapp.brightcove.com/receive_token # MUST be https
        &amp;trusted=true
        &amp;maximum_scope=[{&quot;identity&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;video-cloud-account&quot;,&quot;account-id&quot;:&quot;all&quot;},&quot;operations&quot;:[&quot;video-cloud/player/read&quot;]}]&#39;
     --user cjeris # Your login.arc username
     https://private.oauth.brightcove.com/OAuth/private/v3/client_apps
</code></pre>

<p>This will challenge you for your login.arc password (as part of the
HTTP Basic authentication you supplied with --user) and also a
passphrase for the client certificate.  On QA the passphrase for the
client cert is &#39;1234abcd&#39;.  Contact Team OAuth for help getting the
client cert authentication working.  If everything goes well, you will
get back a blob of JSON containing a client ID and client secret and
some other things.  Save the client ID, but don&#39;t worry about the
client secret; because your app registration is trusted, you will need
to authenticate in exactly this way every time you read or update the
app registration, and your secret is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Say the client ID you got back from this call was
c29c66c4-5341-4d16-ac19-49e99f84ae7.  You could then request an access
token in the implicit flow like this:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">curl -i -H &#39;Authorization: BC_TOKEN &lt;BC_TOKEN authenticating a user with access to account 8523&gt;&#39;
     &#39;https://oauth.brightcove.com/v3/authorization?
        client_id=c29c66c4-5341-4d16-ac19-49e99f84ae7 # have to specify the client you&#39;re requesting for
       &amp;response_type=token # Tells OAuth you want to use the implicit flow
       &amp;state=Massachusetts # This parameter is reproduced unchanged in the response, it&#39;s for CSRF prevention
       &amp;scope=8523__vca:video-cloud/player/read # The account ID and operation you&#39;re asking for on the token
       &amp;redirect_uri=https://myapp.brightcove.com/receive_token&#39; # Optional, but must match the client.  Note redirect_ur*i* here not ur*L*.
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming everything authenticates, you will get back a redirect to
your redirect URI with the access token packed into the fragment ID.
Be aware that the fragment ID will probably be gigantic (500-1000
characters).</p>

<p>The base URL of the public API endpoint is
<code>https://oauth.brightcove.com/v3/client_apps</code>.</p>

<p>To use the private endpoint or a OAuth in a different environment,
consult the &quot;Where is OAuth?&quot; section of the
<a href="https://confluence.vidmark.local/display/DEV/OAuth#OAuth-WhereisOAuth?">OAuth Confluence page</a>.</p>

<p>Parameters and authorization (depending on trust status) as above.
Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li>200 OK, (should be 201 Created, but isn&#39;t yet) if the request is
successful; response body is a JSON encoding of the app registration
including client ID and secret.  This is the <strong>only</strong> time the
client secret will ever be returned.</li>
<li>400 Bad Request if some parameter fails to validate.</li>
<li>403 Forbidden if this is a trusted app registration and the
requested maximum scope is not allowed through the endpoint used.</li>

<p>Authorization (depending on trust status) as above.  There is
currently <em>no</em> &quot;index&quot; API to query app registrations or retrieve them
except by individual client ID.  Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li>200 OK if the request is successful; response body is a JSON
encoding of the app registration, not including secrets.</li>
<li>401 Unauthorized if this is a trusted app registration and auth

supplied, or if this is an untrusted app registration and the client
secret was not supplied.</li>
<li>Other error responses as for creation above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Update</h3>

<pre><code>PUT https://oauth.brightcove.com/v3/client_apps/:client_id
PUT https://private.oauth.brightcove.com/OAuth/private/v3/client_apps/:client_id
</code></pre>

<p>Parameters and authorization (depending on trust status) as above.
Parameters are the same as for creation except that <strong>trusted</strong> may not be
updated.  Returns as for retrieval above.</p>

<h3>Revocation</h3>

<pre><code>DELETE https://oauth.brightcove.com/v3/client_apps/:client_id
DELETE https://private.oauth.brightcove.com/OAuth/private/v3/client_apps/:client_id

<p>Authorization (depending on trust status) as above.  The client
registration is not deleted, merely marked <strong>revoked</strong>.  Un-revocation
is not possible.  Returns as for retrieval above, except that
successful revocation only reports success, it does not return the
revoked registration.</p>
